## üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3cx-reamaze-integration.git
cd 3cx-reamaze-integration
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
REAMAZE_USERNAME=your_reamaze_email
REAMAZE_API_TOKEN=your_reamaze_api_token
REAMAZE_BRAND=your_reamaze_subdomain (e.g., mycompany if your URL is mycompany.reamaze.io)

## üîê Authentication

All API requests require an `Authorization` header with a base64-encoded token:

```bash
Authorization: Basic base64(api_token:dummy)
```

Only the **token** part is validated for now.
